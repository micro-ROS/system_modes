# ROS 2 System Modes

This repository explores a system modes concept that is implemented for ROS 2 in two packages:
* [system_modes](./system_modes/) provides a library for system mode inference, a mode manager, and a mode monitor
* [system_modes_examples](./system_modes_examples/) implements a simple example

For further information, please contact [Arne Nordmann](https://github.com/norro) or [Ralph Lange](https://github.com/ralph-lange).

## Purpose of the Project

This software is not ready for production use. It has neither been developed nor
tested for a specific use case. However, the license conditions of the
applicable Open Source licenses allow you to adapt the software to your needs.
Before using it in a safety relevant setting, make sure that the software
fulfills your requirements and adjust it according to any applicable safety
standards, e.g., ISO 26262.

## How to Build, Test, Install, and Use

After you cloned this repository into your ROS 2 workspace folder, you may build and install the [system_modes](./system_modes/) package and the [system_modes_examples](./system_modes_examples/) package using colcon:  
$ `colcon build --packages-select-regex system_modes`

Have a look at the [system_modes_examples](./system_modes_examples/) documentation to try your installation.

For using this package and designing system modes for your system, please refer to the [How to Apply](./system_modes/README.md#how-to-apply) section.

## License

ROS 2 System Modes are open-sourced under the Apache-2.0 license. See the
[LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

For a list of other open-source components included in ROS 2 system_modes,
see the file [3rd-party-licenses.txt](3rd-party-licenses.txt).

## Known Issues/Limitations

Please notice the following issues/limitations:

* Currently, (sub-)systems managed by the mode manager are not recognized by the `ros2 lifecycle` tool (*"Node not found"*). So to trigger lifecycle transitions in (sub-)systems, you have to go with the `ros2 service call` tool. Check the [system_modes_examples](./system_modes_examples/) documentation for example calls.
