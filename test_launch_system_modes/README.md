# ROS 2 System Modes

The system modes concept assumes that a robotics system is built from components with a lifecycle. It adds a notion of (sub-)systems, hiararchically grouping these nodes, as well as a notion of *modes* that determine the configuration of these nodes and (sub-)systems in terms of their parameter values.

General information about this repository, including legal information, project context, build instructions and known issues/limitations, are given in [README.md](../README.md) in the repository root.

## Test Launch System Modes Package
